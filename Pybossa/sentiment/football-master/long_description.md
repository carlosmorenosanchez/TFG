Analisis Emociones Tweets is an application for PyBossa that is going to show football tweets to make a classification of which emotion each tweet represents.


The application provides three sentiment answers as action buttons:

  * Positivo
  * Negativo
  * Neutro



Based on the answer of the users, we will be able to classify the tweets,
distributing the tasks (thanks to PyBossa) to different users and volunteers.
